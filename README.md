## Arkera Coding Exercise

A web page that displays a table of cities and their number of high-rise buildings. Data is provided via a CSV file whic is parsed into the application using the npm package Papa Parse. 

The webpage also display the table with rows sorted by a column specified in the url, i.e.:
- http://base-url-of-the-webpage/city ==> will display the table with rows ordered by the
city names.
- http://base-url-of-the-webpage/100+ ==> will display the table with rows ordered by the
"100+ (m)" column and so on.

### Framework Used 

The application is written in the Javascript framework, React.js.

### Running Locally

#### Mac

Go to this repository and click on the 'Clone or download' green button. Then copy the URL that appears (git@github.com:harrygturner/arkera-challenge.git). 

Open up terminal and move yourself into a directory you wish this file to be located in and then issue the command:

git clone <URL you copied (git@github.com:harrygturner/arkera-challenge.git)>

into the command line. Then using the command line enter the file you just created. As you are using a Mac python has already been installed so to set up a local server follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the public file inside the file you are currently in.
2. Once there enter command $ ls and should appear a list of files. If one such file appears that is named 'index.html' your in the correct file.
